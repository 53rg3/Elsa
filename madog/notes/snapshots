1. Repo must be registered in elasticsearch.yml prior of registering it via PUT /_snapshot/[REPO_NAME]
path.repo: ["/mount/backups", "/mount/longterm_backups"]

After all nodes are restarted, the following command can be used to register the shared file system repository with the name my_backup:
```
PUT /_snapshot/my_fs_backup
{
    "type": "fs",
    "settings": {
        "location": "/home/cc/Desktop/Programming/Software/Elastic/backup",
        "compress": true
    }
}
```
